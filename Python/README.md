# get_comets.py

Run to get all hyperbolic and parabolic comets from JPL SBDB, and write to a CSV.

# lambert.py

Wrapper for lambert solver. Includes some experiment rust based optimizations. Can ignore the rust stuff, it will detect if that's missing and use a python lambert solver instead, which is just slightly slower.

Don't actually run this, just import it when you need a lambert solver.

# porkchop.py

Run to create porkchop plots of all comets from CSV generated by get_comets.py

To run on a specific comet, modify the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to just run the `run()` function once with the comet name, ID, and perihelion time that you want.
